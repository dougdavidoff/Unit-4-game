# Unit-4-game
Crystal Collector Game for Week 4 Homework


I felt more confident, and earlier in the week, about this game than about any previous homework. I think the assignment is one-third accrued learning; one-third looking it up online; and one-third consulting with the instructors. And one-fifth still not completed but oh-so-close.

WINS:
I finally integrated a number of concepts and practices in this assignment: HTML, CSS positioning without Bootstrap, javascript, and basic jQuery. I was able to understand answers I found for myself online and I was able to keep a running list of challenes I faced. I enen added features, like a timer in the message scoreboard.

CHALLENGES:
As I said in class, I can use the new words of coding, but I cannot "spell" them. Which is to say, I know the concepts and the language, but the syntax and punctuation elude me.

PROGNOSIS:
I look forward to the trivia game, which is next week's assignment.
